### Predict stock market prices using RNN
This is fork of Lilian Weng project. I changed the original project so that it would work with Python 3 and also was able to read data from the Polish stock exchange download from BOSSA.pl. 
One of the goals was also creation of Jupyter Notebook which is able to work with this project. I described whole process in my blog post [code-addict.pl](http://code-addict.pl). To use this project without Jupyter Notebooks please refer to original description made by Lilian Weng in her [GitHub](https://github.com/lilianweng/stock-rnn).
